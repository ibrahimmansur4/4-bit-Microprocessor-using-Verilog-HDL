# 4-bit-Microprocessor-using-Verilog-HDL
Design of a simple 4-bit number crunching
machine (which you may also call as 4-bit Microprocessor) from a custom
ISA using Verilog HDL. In doing so, you’ll also create the bare-metal pro-
gramming of your microprocessor.
The design is broadely divided into three parts, namely - Arithmetic Logic
Unit (ALU), Data Registers and Control Logic.
• 4-bit D-type Registers
• 4-bit Binary Full Adder
• 4-bit Binary Counter
• Quad 2-Data Selectors
• 2-Line to 4-Line Decoder
• AND, OR, NOT and XOR Gates
• Parallel Address, Parallel 8-bit I/O EEPROM
